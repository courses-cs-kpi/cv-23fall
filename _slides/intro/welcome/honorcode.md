## Academic integrity

You may discuss the programming assignments in groups. However, each student must
write down their own solutions independently. While taking this course, you are obliged to adhere to the policy and principles of academic integrity defined by the Honor Code of Igor Sikorsky Kyiv Polytechnic Institute ([see Part 3](https://kpi.ua/en/code))  and all of the following rules:

1. You must submit solutions, reports or program code that are your own. The usage of solutions or program code that are not your own and presenting them for one’s
own work is plagiarism and a serious violation of the basic academic standards.

1. You must not share your solution code with other students, nor ask others to share their solutions with you.

1. You must indicate on your submission any assistance you received.

## RULES FOR ETHICAL BEHAVIOR

Rules of ethical behavior of students and employees of the university are defined in the Honor Code of Igor Sikorsky Kyiv Polytechnic Institute ([see Part 2](https://kpi.ua/en/code)).

## Deadlines for assignments

The teacher sets a deadline for the completion of all types of tasks with the aim of consistent and balanced assimilation of the educational material by students and monitoring of the students' implementation of individual study plans according to the schedule of the educational process. Submitting completed tasks for verification after the set deadlines is accompanied by penalty points. The deadline for submitting all types of assignments for review is the last computer lab session.  You have the opportunity to redo the assignment on retakes in order to improve your current rating.

## Assessment appeal procedure

If you think your work has been underestimated or overestimated, you may contact the teacher who performed the evaluation and report this with a brief justification (the evaluation will be revised).
