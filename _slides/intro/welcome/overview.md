This course will introduce you to deep learning approaches that are used in cutting-edge research in computer vision (CV) and provide practical experience:
 1. Using of neural networks (fully connected and convolutional layers, forward and backward propagation, activation functions, ... )
 1. Training of neural networks (initialization, optimization, regularization, model choice, ... )

 
Course Learning Outcomes
: 
- Identify problems where computer vision techniques are applicable.
- Apply CV techniques for some classical problems.
